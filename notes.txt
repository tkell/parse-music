RELEASES

I think this is it:
- Carly Rae Jepsen - Dedicated [School Boy]
  - 01 - Julien.flac
  ...
  - 05 - Everything He Needs.marker
  ...
  - cover.jpg
  - discogs_metadata.json

How do I group these?
- Collect every file in /Singles
- Group by artist and label, give each a number
- group, say, 2, 4, 8
  - maybe wire in a discogs search?
  - enter a an album name
  - move to /Releases/<artist> - <album> - [<label>]
  - hey hey, call Discogs, get the meta, fill in the markers here!
    - (this is hard, blregh)
  - move files with proper names (01 - track, 02 - track (remix), etc)
- repeat until we're out of file for that artist!
    
Oh, ugh, first I need to update the current parser to do this, hiss
- hmm, or we could just run the above grouper on `parsed`?
- That feels a bit dodgy, but it is nice, I think
- it means if we have 3 very disparate tracks from one release, we can just put 'em together
