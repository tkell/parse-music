# Purpose
- This lib now just gives things correct metadata, but does not group singles into albums
  That requires a discogs lookup, so it is in the other folder
 
# Tech debt
- I shoud upgrade mutagen to latest, and then make sure it works with FLAC and mp3
- tag_utils might need a rewrite to case on FLAC, which are easy, and mp3, which might need:
  - audio["title"] = mutagen.id3.TextFrame(encoding=3, text=[u"An example"])
- (oh, these were _rips_, why did I mp3 encode them?)
- Regardless, I should check all this, maybe even write tests for this code, har har
