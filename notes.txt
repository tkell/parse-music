## Tech debt game
- I shoud upgrade mutagen to latest, and then make sure it works with FLAC and mp3
- tag_utils might need a rewrite to case on FLAC, which are easy, and mp3, which might need:
  - audio["title"] = mutagen.id3.TextFrame(encoding=3, text=[u"An example"])
- (oh, these were _rips_, why did I mp3 encode them?)
- Regardless, I should check all this, maybe even write tests for this code, har har

Folks at work recommend Musicbrainz / Picard, I should try this for cover art!


RELEASES
Oh, ugh, first I need to update the current parser to do this, hiss
- hmm, or we could just run the grouper on `parsed`?
- That feels a bit dodgy, but it is nice, I think
- it means if we have 3 very disparate tracks from one release, we can just put 'em together
