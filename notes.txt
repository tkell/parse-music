## Tech debt game
- I shoud upgrade mutagen to latest, and then make sure it works with FLAC and mp3
- tag_utils might need a rewrite to case on FLAC, which are easy, and mp3, which might need:
  - audio["title"] = mutagen.id3.TextFrame(encoding=3, text=[u"An example"])
- (oh, these were _rips_, why did I mp3 encode them?)
- Regardless, I should check all this, maybe even write tests for this code, har har




RELEASES

- this needs a ton of error catching / dealing with missing things
- needs to confirm that release_details["title"] is what we want for the folder name
  - it sometimes has artist info in it, hiss

I think this is it:
- Carly Rae Jepsen - Dedicated [School Boy]
  - 01 - Julien.flac
  ...
  - 05 - Everything He Needs.marker
  ...
  - cover.jpg
  - discogs_metadata.json


- or just 01 - Julien.flac, and then a discogs_urls.txt?
- or "20.tracks" and "discogs-urls.txt"
- I don't really want to enter 20 tracks by hand for the inevitable V/A release that is not on discogs
- And I do trust myself to have picked the right tracks, hmm
- about 70% of tracks are legit singles!
    
Oh, ugh, first I need to update the current parser to do this, hiss
- hmm, or we could just run the above grouper on `parsed`?
- That feels a bit dodgy, but it is nice, I think
- it means if we have 3 very disparate tracks from one release, we can just put 'em together
